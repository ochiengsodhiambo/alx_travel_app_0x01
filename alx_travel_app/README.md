### Creating Views and API Endpoints
The alx_travel_app implements API views to manage listings and bookings. 
It creates fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints using Django REST Framework (DRF) 
and documents them with Swagger for ease of access and testing. 
The focus is on following RESTful API design principles while ensuring endpoints are properly tested for reliability.
